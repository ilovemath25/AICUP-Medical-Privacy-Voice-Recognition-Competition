11372.wav," If we're just calling that basically seeing, caring about the life of another person, it's fundamental to every healthy relationship, not something you need to get over. That's what you want to be part of your marriage and you want it to be reciprocal. That's what's different about not being motherly, right? In that place, it's the mother's job to be that caring concern for the child and for the child not necessarily early on to have to even think about how the mother is doing so much."
11383.wav," although the bottom floor of not ideal is really bad. Right, and I think I was more commenting that and listening to you, not ideal is often equivalent with not okay or not encompassing a broader range. You may be right. You listen to me and you listen very, very well."

Maybe we haven't talked much about that because I don't remember some of that, or maybe it was a while ago and I forgot who knows. Anyway, whatever. The point is clearly you're having a very shitty time and it certainly makes sense to me that you could lead one to dump more on their spouse."

You know, I think the other thing is the feeling, the first feeling that I think I can get in touch with is anger and I don't want to, you know, feel it. I just feel like this whole thing with Harold just has, you know, built up in me for a long time. Just anger at him, not feeling well."
11541.wav," She's unhappy most of the time in that. And I guess I feel like I don't really trust her to, or like same extent at all.

I mean, they do it all the time, but it's just like I haven't been there in a long time. So for me, it's a bit scary. So it's nice that he was there with me. Yeah. But how can I feel secure if I've had him it? If I'm a sidekick? Well, it's funny. Isn't it funny?

12040.wav," And some of that is related to the deadlines and so forth. But part of it is I have a difficult time estimating how long something's going to take. Sometimes I do things like this where that should not have been possible, but I did it. So that makes it harder to estimate the next time how long is that task going to actually take. I have no idea how long that task should have taken now. All I can say is that it took a whole lot of work and I did it in that. So there's that piece. There's also, I didn't want to reschedule it.

One is what are you worried about in sort of saying in the moment when you're not feeling upset about something like this? I mean we've talked since when Tawny was here that she has a hard time handling me being upset and so like I am concerned that me being angry is going to impact her negatively but in a dangerous way. Is the dangerous part the important part?
18312.wav," then that there's certainly intentionally you're inputting that I'm not feeling like I'm going into a particular direction, direction consciously, but"

18373.wav," And I also think that this being that I'm working full time and he's working part time and it's, you know, way less. It's two days a week. Well, it's four days a week, but hours wise, it's maybe 12 hours a week. I just feel like that should make our life easier because Harold has time to do a lot of things that I'm still doing.

18397.wav," Yeah, I don't have a particularly clear view of what a tenable strategy is at this point. Well, when one feels really, really angry at the person or people they love being worried about the impact of that anger, I think is a general fear. I mean, I think that's kind of a fear in general that you might have regardless of Tanya's psychological state. Sure. And then it's exacerbated by it. So what do people do?"
18412.wav," So I'm going to move on to the other questions now. I asked you, I think at the end of last session that had you ever been suicidal and whether you would lie to me, you were struck by the pairing of those questions."

I mean, he's been using shampoo to wash his body for over a month because he can't remember to take his new borough syrup into the shower. I mean, things actually happen that affect me. So it's not like we've been down the road. I can let it go or I should let it go. And it just falls on him and maybe he'll learn consequences. The whole, it doesn't happen. He doesn't get worked up about the consequences. I do and they affect me too."
1848.wav, I mean in reality I guess I'm not doing everything sometimes he does things but I think I still think it's pretty unbalanced. It feels a bit lopsided. Yeah it's not like I take down and write every time I've cooked or he's cooked dinner for me or stuff so I could be wrong about this but I don't think I am.

18678.wav," I'm clear that when we've talked about this before, I put it in a very direct manner. Tanya's tendency to abdicate her responsibility and your tendency to fill in all of the spaces of responsibility, whether it's your responsibility or not, even in your entitlement or not to do so does not fit well.

I have pretty much the same conversation with James once a week, where I'm so anxious that I'm like, well, maybe I should just drop this altogether and look at other fields, like look for a different job altogether. James always says, well, if you take a full-time job, you won't be able to teach next year."
20211.wav," And when I would take it, I felt weird, you know, so I stopped. I was just like, this is crazy. So I turned to coffee because there was a story of a model in Florida that died taking a bunch of it. It was also used for weight loss. Right. So I think I might have even been taking it for that as well. It definitely suppresses the appetite. Right."
20286.wav," Is James at home or out somewhere? He's at home. What did he say when you? Yeah. Did you watch anything yesterday? I don't know. It doesn't matter. No, are you sure of that? Yeah, I wasn't so sure of making it through the weekend. Yeah, I know I continue to put the decision about this in your hands, but I assume."

And one of the biggest things that I, it doesn't feel fair to criticize, but in finding that our expectations, my expectations, which she said were totally on board, like he was on board with them.

And I'm not sure anything came out of it. That's too bad. I mean, it didn't end badly. It just kind of ended uncomfortable. How did Josh feel about it?"
20451.wav," The fact that he kept on telling me that's okay and nobody minds. It's a really uncomfortable feeling to have someone be angry. I sort of feel, I felt sort of betrayed by that.

20543.wav, I'm saying that it can be difficult to diagnose ADD and people can often over diagnose it That's largely because there are other conditions that can result in the same symptoms It's good to work with somebody who is more specialized The most specialized people are neuropsychologists The second most specialized people are usually mental health clinicians that work with kids the third most specialized are Pediatricians not that they're bad

20565.wav," And so when you did ask about cognitive behavioral therapy, the next step there, so one step would be, is what you just did for me.

I mean, I don't know how much you ignore him, but it's not something kids get used to. I don't ignore him that much. He has so many damned questions. He sounds like a very energetic, vigorous, curious, active kid. Yeah."
20633.wav," No, it's not. I just don't want to be this overweight. I guess it's just discouraging that he can do it without seemingly little effort. And that it's taking more effort for you.

I know you're not making that up and I know it's really unpleasant. Absolutely. I'm not sure is this like a bid for attention? Do you want somebody to run in and help you out or fix it or make it better and tell you what to do? Is it because, you know, if you've had instructions then you'd actually be responsible?"
21410.wav," Yeah. So if you're suffering, it means you're going to be by yourself. Yeah. Which again is probably some broader existential question, but I'm not intending. No, it's okay. Clearly. I talked to my sister on the phone yesterday and I was doing pretty badly. She was having a good day."
21421.wav," I hear a lot of suffering will bring you closer to God and I hear a lot of suffering will help you be a better person, understand other people better or be closer to other people.
